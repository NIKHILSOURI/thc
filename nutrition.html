                <h2>Nutrition</h2>
                <p>While food remains crucial for meeting nutritional needs, the encroachment of modernization has seen a decline in traditional dietary practices , resulting in imbalanced nutrition . This shift has created a noticeable disparity in nutrient
                    intake, disrupting the equilibrium of everyday life. However, the growing affluence among the workforce, coupled with evolving lifestyles and the escalating costs associated with healthcare, are compelling individuals to reassess their
                    approach towards wellness.</p>
