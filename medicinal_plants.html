                <h2>Traditional Medicine</h2>
                <p>Approximately 60 percent of the global population utilizes alternative medicines, which are prevalent not only in rural areas of developing countries but also in developed nations dominated by modern medicine . The Indian subcontinent
                    boasts a vast array of medicinal plants integral to traditional medical treatments. Traditional systems rely on herbs, minerals, and organic matter, with medicinal plants exclusively used for herbal drug preparation. In India, around
                    70 percent of the rural population relies on the Ayurvedic system. While traditional healers typically formulate their remedies, Western countries see about 40 percent of the population turning to herbal medicine. This trend is fueled
                    by governmental and NGO attention, alongside concerns over modern medicine's side effects and costs. India stands as the largest producer of medicinal plants, with approximately 250,000 registered Ayurvedic practitioners compared to
                    700,000 in modern medicine. Despite 20,000 recorded medicinal plants, traditional practitioners primarily use 7,000–7,500 for various diseases. Ayurveda leads with 2000 plants, followed by Siddha (1300), Unani (1000), Homeopathy (800),
                    Tibetan (500), Modern (200), and folk (4500). Over 1.5 million practitioners employ traditional medicine in India, supported by an estimated 7800 manufacturing units requiring over 2000 tons of medicinal plant material annually. Additionally,
                    more than 1500 herbals are marketed as dietary supplements or ethnic traditional medicines.</p>
