                <h2>A Brief Introduction on <span>Traditional Medicine</span></h2>
                <p>India's rich heritage encompasses traditional medicinal systems such as Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani, documented even in ancient scriptures like the Vedas. Originating between 2500 and 500 BC, Ayurveda, literally translating to "science
                    of life," focuses on holistic well-being and disease management. Emphasizing metabolic balance, Ayurveda is hailed as the "science of longevity," offering comprehensive lifestyle guidelines for sustained health. Its dietary principles
                    and rejuvenation therapies address common ailments, including food allergies, often underserved by modern medicine. Yet, Ayurvedic nutrition necessitates active patient involvement and commitment, steering away from a quick-fix mentality.
                    Instead, it champions self-awareness, empowerment, and a lifelong commitment to health—a holistic approach fostering responsibility and longevity.</p>
